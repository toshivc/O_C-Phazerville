## Phazerville Suite - an active o_C firmware fork

Using [Benisphere](https://github.com/benirose/O_C-BenisphereSuite) as a starting point, this branch takes the Hemisphere Suite in new directions, with several new applets and enhancements to existing ones. I've merged bleeding-edge features from other clever developers, with the goal of cramming as much functionality and flexibility into the nifty dual-applet design as possible!

I've also included all of the stock O&C firmware apps, although they don't all fit in one build. I provide 3 different builds with various combinations of apps, listed in the [Release Notes](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/releases).

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/wiki) for more info.

### Notable Features in this branch:

* 4 Preset banks for Hemisphere (long-press DOWN button)
* Modal-editing style navigation (push to toggle editing)
* Expanded internal clock
  - Note: press both UP+DOWN buttons quickly to access the [**Clock Setup**](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/wiki/Clock-Setup) screen
  - Syncs to external clock on TR1, configurable PPQN
  - MIDI Clock out via USB
  - Independent multipliers for each internal trigger
  - Manual triggers (convenient for jogging or resetting a sequencer, testing)
* A new App called [**Calibr8or**](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/wiki/Calibr8or)
  - quad performance quantizer + pitch CV fine-tuning tool, 4 preset banks
* **[DualTM](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/wiki/DualTM)** - ShiftReg has been upgraded to two concurrent 32-bit registers governed by the same length/prob/scale/range settings
  - outputs assignable to Pitch, Mod, Trig, Gate from either register. Assignable CV inputs. Massive modulation potential!
* **EbbAndLfo** (via [qiemem](https://github.com/qiemem/O_C-HemisphereSuite/tree/trig-and-tides))
  - mini implementation of MI Tides, with v/oct tracking
* **EuclidX** - AnnularFusion got a makeover, now includes padding, configurable CV input modulation

* LoFi Tape has been transformed into **LoFi Echo** - a crazy bitcrushing digital delay line
  - (credit to [armandvedel](https://github.com/armandvedel/O_C-HemisphereSuite_log) for the initial idea)
* Sequence5 -> **SequenceX** (8 steps max) (from [logarhythm](https://github.com/Logarhythm1/O_C-HemisphereSuite))
* lots of other small tweaks + experimental applets

### How do I try it?

Check the [Releases](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-BenisphereSuite/releases) section for a .hex file, or clone the repository and build it yourself! I think the beauty of this module is the fact that it's relatively easy to modify and build the source code to reprogram it. You are free to customize the firmware, similar to how you've no doubt already selected a custom set of physical modules.

### How do I build it?

I've abandoned the old Arduino IDE in favor of Platform IO, a Python-based build toolchain, available as either a [standalone CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/methods/installer-script.html):
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformio/platformio-core-installer/master/get-platformio.py -O get-platformio.py
python3 get-platformio.py
```
...or as a [a full-featured IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide), as well as a plugin for VSCode and other existing IDEs.

The project lives within the `software/o_c_REV` directory. From there, you can Build the desired configuration and Upload via USB to your module:
```
pio run -e main -t upload
```
Alternate build environment configurations exist in `platformio.ini` for VOR, Buchla, flipped screen, etc. To build all the defaults consecutively, simply use `pio run`

### Credits

Many minds before me have made this project possible. Attribution is present in the git commit log and within individual files.
Shoutouts:
* Logarhythm1 for the incredible **TB-3PO** sequencer.
* herrkami and Beni Rose for their work on **BugCrack**.
* Ben also gets massive props for **DrumMap** and the **ProbDiv / ProbMelo** applets.
* qiemem (Bryan Head) for the **Ebb&LFO** applet and its _tideslite_ backend

And, of course, thank you to Chysn for the clever applet framework from which we've all drawn inspiration.

This is a fork of [Benisphere Suite](https://github.com/benirose/O_C-BenisphereSuite) which is a fork of [Hemisphere Suite](https://github.com/Chysn/O_C-HemisphereSuite) by Jason Justian (aka chysn).

ornament**s** & crime**s** is a collaborative project by Patrick Dowling (aka pld), mxmxmx and Tim Churches (aka bennelong.bicyclist) (though mostly by pld and bennelong.bicyclist). it **(considerably) extends** the original firmware for the o_C / ASR eurorack module, designed by mxmxmx.
