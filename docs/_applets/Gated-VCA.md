# Gated VCA

![Screenshot 2024-06-13 15-05-45](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/assets/109086194/72906be7-478b-449f-8edf-cea1327e662c)

**Gated VCA** is a VCA with the ability to gate the first output, and independently mute the second output. It can sort of be used for audio, but works best as an extra CV VCA. The display visualizes outputs A and B as the solid bars on the far left and right, respectively. The input signal is visualized as the hollow bar on the centre left, and the amplification CV on the centre right.

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   | Ch A Gate    |  Ch B Mute (reverse gate)  |
| CV INs |  Input signal   |   Amplification CV  |
| OUTs   |  Ch A output   |  Ch B output    |


### UI Parameters
* CV offset
