**EnvFollow** is a dual envelope follower / ducker, with adjustable gain and response speed

### I/O

|        |       1/3       |       2/4       |
| ------ | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| TRIG   |    No effect    |    No effect    |
| CV INs | Channel 1 Input | Channel 2 Input |
| OUTs   |   Envelope 1    |   Envelope 2    |

### UI Parameters
* Mode Selection
	* Follow: Envelope output matches input signal amplitude
	* Duck: Envelope output inverse of input signal amplitude
* Gain (higher values produce an envelope that is more sensitive to the input signal), up to 31x
* Response speed (both channels)
