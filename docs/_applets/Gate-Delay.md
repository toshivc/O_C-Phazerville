![Screenshot 2024-06-13 15-05-13](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/assets/109086194/52e1c03c-d391-4fd6-9bbe-1bc45e18a550)

Gate Delay is a dual trigger/gate delay loosely based on the Ladik S-189. Gate Delay has a 1ms resolution and a 2 second recording time. Modulation is bi-polar and can change the time by up to 1000ms.


### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   | Clock Ch1 | Clock Ch2 |
| CV INs | Time mod Ch1 | Time mod Ch2 |
| OUTs   | Delayed Trigger Ch1 | Delayed Trigger Ch2 |

### UI Controls
* Per channel: Set delay time, from 0ms to 2000ms
