# SeqPlay7

**SeqPlay7** allows you to make playlists of your [Seq32](Seq32) sequences.

At each of the 7 steps, you can specify which sequence to play (#1 - #8), how many times to repeat the sequence before moving to the next step, and finally which quantizer engine to use.

When a step is highlighted for editing, use the AuxButton to tab through the step options (sequence, quantizer, repeats)
