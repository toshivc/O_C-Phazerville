# Metronome

![Screenshot 2024-06-13 15-09-08](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/assets/109086194/edc51d8c-2093-44b5-bdff-03344b200703)

**Metronome** is a simple tempo control & visualizer for the Hemisphere [internal clock](Clock-Setup). The output is subject to any multiplication or division set in the Clock Setup menu (press UP + DOWN buttons simultaneously) to Trigger input 1/3.

If the clock is running, you'll see a small metronome icon on the main screen header. To arm, start or stop the clock, long-hold the left encoder button. This functionality is global to Hemispheres, and does not require the metronome applet to be loaded.

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   |  N/A   | N/A    |
| CV INs |   N/A  |  N/A   |
| OUTs   | Multiplied clock (while internal clock is running) | None |


### UI Controls
* Encoder: Sets the tempo of the internal clock (before any multiplication or division is applied)
