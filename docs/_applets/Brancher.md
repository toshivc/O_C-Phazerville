**Brancher** is a Bernoulli Gate, inspired by Mutable Instruments Branches. It sends incoming gate or clock to one of two outputs, based on a selected probability.

### I/O

|        |                1/3                 |    2/4     |
| ------ | :--------------------------------: | :--------: |
| TRIG   | Signal (clock or gate) for routing | No effect  |
| CV INs |  Probability modulation (bipolar)  | No effect  |
| OUTs   |             Output A/C             | Output B/D |

### UI Parameters
* Probability
* Press encoder to override probability-selected output and switch to the other one
