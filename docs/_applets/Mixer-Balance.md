# Mixer:Balance

![Screenshot 2024-06-13 15-13-38](https://github.com/djphazer/O_C-Phazerville/assets/109086194/d22fd6ef-0bff-4398-ac00-e75c26a79de7)

**Mixer:Balance** is a two-input CV mixer with a balance control and two complementary outputs.

### I/O

|        | 1/3 | 2/4 |
| ------ | :-: | :-: |
| TRIG   |     |     |
| CV INs | Input 1 | Input 2 |
| OUTs   | Mixed Output 1 | Mixed Output 2 |

### UI Control
* Encoder: Adjusts the balance between CV 1 and CV 2

The balance indicator, controlled by the encoder, shows the relationship between the CV 1 and CV 2 signals' relative levels at Output A/C. With the indicator all the way to the left, only CV 1's signal appears at A/C; all the way to the right, only CV 2's signal appears at A/C.

Output B/D is the complement of A/C. That is, the relative levels of CV 1 and CV 2 are the opposite, so that with the balance indicator at the left, only CV 2's signal appears at B/D, etc.

In Mixer:Balance, all signals are attenuated by 50% before being sent to the mix.
